	<h3>Vinny and Vanya Stroza</h3>
	<p>A middle aged man and young blonde daughter that the heroes befriended in the small village of Voltera. After the fall of Voltera, Vinny suggested the group came with him to Rozarria to look for work as his cousin, Hinno, works as a cobblemaker by the port. During the trip, Dabdoob learned that Vinny's wife had been taken by half-orcs.</p>
	<h3>Barbosa</h3>
	<p>Captain of a small ship that when meeting the party, had been assigned to capture a conman gnome known as Novak Brada. He then assigned the task to our group in exchange for passage across the Nabreus Sea. Once across the sea, the party learned that he works for an individual known as The Broker.</p>
