		After the events in Voltera, Vinny suggests to the party to make their way across the Nabreus sea to meet with his brother in Rozarria who could provide work for them.
		The party found a ship, ran by a man known as Captain Barbosa who would take them across the sea if they could capture a con-gnome who goes by Novak Brada.  Koveus and Lyra end up at a bar to ask about any new gnomes in the town while Dabdoob encounters some local drunks who have been complaining about a "fuckin' gnome" who they lost a lot of gold to. <br><br>
		After some investigating, they learn Novak has been conning the local residents and upon confronting him, he charms Koveus to be his friend while he tries to escape. Dabdoob ends up apprehending him but not quick enough as Novak successfully charms his as well. Knowing the only way to release Dabdoob from this charm is inflicting damage, Koveus springs into action, casting Eldritch Blast. It ends up releasing Dabdoob from the charm while cutting his HP in half and knocking Novak unconscious. Now fully back in control, Dabdoob agrees, fuckin' gnomes. <br><br>
		Returning to the ship with Vinny, Vanya and dragging along behind them the unconscious Novak Brada, Captain barbosa welcomes them back onto the ship just as nightfall hits and they make their way to Rozarria. Dabdoob dreams of his homeland which he may be returning to sooner than he'd like. He speaks with Vinny and learns of that a group of half-orcs were responsible for the abduction of Vinny's wife, Vanya's mother.
		While Koveus and Lyra admire the stars, the ship is ambushed by aquatic humanoid figures known as the Kuo-Toa. In a victorious fight, Dabdoob protects Vinny and Vanya, Koveus blasted one of the creatures back to the depths, Lyra toppling one over from the crow's nest and Barbosa slicing one up. After discarding the corpses into the sea, the rest of the night remained uneventful and as dawn crested, the land of Rozarria entered their sight.

		The party and Barbosa's ship land at Balfonheim Port, the main trade port for the economy of Rozarria. The 3 heroes said a temporary goodbye to Vinny and Vanya who would be staying with Vinny's brother, Hinno, the local cobbler. <br><br>
		Learning that an individual named The Broker is the one who hired Captain Barbosa to bring Novak Brada back, Barbosa led them to the Narrow Nightingale where they left Novak inside a crate to be collected by the Broker. The party split at this point, agreeing to meet at the Pink Salmon Bar soon.<br><br>
		Koveus fearing they had just led Novak to his death, went back to look for him but stumbled upon The Broker torturing Novak. Koveus tried to make a move to save Novak but after his disguise fails, he ran out of fear for his own life. Koveus ran across town where he ultimately ran into an imp, which he formed an unnatural bond with.
		At the Pink Salmon, Lyra encounters a young human male named Anando who after a few friendly wagers, forfeited a map of Rozarria to her.<br><br>
		Food and drink were had but screams and a large shadow filled the streets not long after. Running to the scene of the disturbance, the party were face to face with a Vrock, a large demon with the likeness of a vulture with 4 legs. As the party seemed to be too weak to take this creature down, an unknown individual stepped in and with his lightning elemental attacks, scared the creature away.<br><br>
		This shiny blue armour wearing individual disapproved of the party's actions, telling them that they only angered the creature and it could have been worse had he not stepped in. Seeing as the party was more of a nuisance than help, this unknown knight told the guards to seize them and that they could be useful in non-endangering work.
		Barbosa stepped in and suggested that The Broker deal with them instead, for which the knight agreed reluctantly.<br><br>
		Barbosa tells the party that the unknown man is known as Tempest, who happens to be affiliated with the Slayer's Take, a group that Barbosa agreed to tell them more about another time. Barbosa led the party back to the Narrow Nightingale, where he introduced them to The Broker who offered them their freedom if they can obtain an artifact found in an abandoned mine along the coast.<br><br>
		Before they set off and prepared for the morning's journey, Novak Brada appeared as a servant to The Broker, missing his right hand as well as his tongue.

	<div class = "content">
		<p>
		The party purchased horses to ease their travel to the abandoned mine, which they found out was half a day's journey north following coast.<br><br>
		After finding the mine's entrance the party cautiously proceeded into it encountering dwarf zombies. After a brief fight, Dabdoob uncovers a mysterious long sword that seemed to be giving off a magical presence.<br><br>
		The party dove deeper into the mine in search of this artifact, fighting off large spiders until they found the main blacksmith room of this mine. Here the party were confronted by 2 phase spiders (human heads with the ability to turn invisible where the pair made their intention to eat the party very clear.<br><br>
		The party defeated these spider-like beings and found a pile of loot that was oddly paced in a pile close to a magical ever-burning fire. In it they found the round artifact they were looking for and Lyra found an odd coin with the symbol of a raven on it.<br><br>
		While exiting the abandoned mine, the mysterious blade that Dabdoob wielded, spoke, asking him if Dabdoob was its new wielder.
