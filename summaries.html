	<h4>Session 1: Fuckin' Gnomes</h4>
	<p>		After the events in Voltera, Vinny suggests to the party to make their way across the Nabreus sea to meet with his brother in Rozarria who could provide work for them. <br>
	The party found a ship, ran by Captain Barbosa who will take them across the sea if they can capture a conman Gnome known as Novak Brada <br>
	Koveus and Lyra end up at a bar to ask about any new gnomes in the town while Dabdoob encounters some local drunks who have been complaining about a "fuckin' gnome' who they lost a good amount of gold to. <br>
	After some investigating,  they find that the Gnome has been conning the local citizens, and upon confronting him he charms Koveus to be his friend while he tries to escape. Dabdoob ends up apprehending him but not quick enough as Novak successfully charms his as well.<br>
	Knowing the only way to release Dabdoob from this charm is inflicting damage, Koveus springs into action, casting Eldritch Blast. It ends up releasing Dabdoob from the charm while cutting his HP in half and knocking Novak unconscious in the spell's wake. Now fully back in control, Dabdoob agrees: 'fuckin' gnomes'<br>
	Returning to the ship with Vinny, Vanya and dragging along behind them Novak Brada, Captain barbosa welcomes them back onto the ship just as nightfall hits and they make their way to Rozarria.<br>
	After Dabdoob awakes in a cold sweat, he and Vinny  chat amongst the stars about Vinny's sad past.<br>
	While Koveus and Lyra admire the stars, the entire ship is ambushed by the aquatic humanoid figures known as the Kuo-Toa. In a victorious fight, Dabdoob protects Vinny and Vanya, Koveus blasting back to where it came from, Lyra toppling one over from the crow's nest and Barbosa slicing one up. <br>
	After discarding the corpses into the sea, the remaining of the night remains quiet and as dawn crests, the land of Rozarria enters into sight.</p>

	<h4> Session 2: What an Entrance </h4>
	<p>		The party makes port at Balfonheim Port (fitting name) with Barbosa, Vinny and Vanya.
	Say temporary goodbye to Vinny and Vanya who will be staying with Vinny's brother Hinno who is a cobbler.<br>
	Learning that the Broker is the one who hired Barbosa to bring Novak Brada back, Barbosa lead them to the Narrow Nightingale where they left him inside a crate to be collected by the Broker.<br>
	The party split at this point, agreeing to meet at the Pink Salmon soon.
	Koveus fearing they had just lead Brada to his death, went back to look for him but stumbled upon the Broker torturing Novak Brada, running now for fear of his own life, Koveus ran across town where he ran into an Imp which he formed an unnatural bond with.
	At the Pink Salmon, Lyra enounters a young human male (Anando) who after a friendly wagers, forfeits a map of Rozarria to the party.<br>
	Food and drink were had but screams and a large shadow filled the streets not longafter. Running to the scene of the disturbance, the party encountered a Vrock, a large demon with the likeness of a vulture with 4 legs.<br>
	As the party seemed to be too weak to take this creature down, an unknown individual stepped in and with his lightning elemental attacks, scared the creature away.
	The individual disapproved of the party's actions, telling them that they only angered the creature and it could have been worse it he did not step in. Seeing as the party was more of a nuisance than help, the unknown knight told the guards to seize them and that they could be put to work in non-endangering work.<br>
	Barbosa stepped in and suggests that the broker deal with them instead, for which the knight agreed reluctantly.<br>
	Barbosa tells the party that the unknown man is known as Tempest, who happens to be affiliated with the Slayer's Take, a group that Barbosa agreed to tell them more about another time.<br>
	Barbosa leading the party back to the Narrow Nightingale, introduces them to the Broker who offers them freedom if they can obtain an artifact found in an abandoned mine along the coast.<br>
	Before they set off and prepare for the morning's journey, Novak Brada appears as a servant to the broker, missing his right hand and his tongue. </p>

	<h4> Session 3: The Abandoned Mine </h4>

	<p>
	The party purchased horses to ease their travel to the abandoned mine, found along the coast to the north of Balfonheim port.<br>
	After finding the entrance the party cautiously proceeded into it encountering dwarven like ghouls/zombies, a mysterious magical blade.<br>
	The party dove deeper fighting off large spiders until they found the main blacksmith room of this mine, where 2 large phase spiders (spiders with human heads and the ability to turn invisible) made their intention to eat the party very clear.<br>
	The party defeated the spider-like beings and found a pile of loot that was oddly paced in a pile close to a magical brewing fire. In it they found the artifact they were looking for, Lyra found an odd coin with the symbol of a raven on it.<br>
	While exiting the cave, the mysterious blade that Dabdoob wielded, spoke, asking him if he was its new wielder.<br>
