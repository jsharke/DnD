		<p>
		After the events in Voltera, Vinny suggests to the party to make their way across the Nabreus sea to meet with his brother in Rozarria who could provide work for them.
		The party found a ship, ran by a man known as Captain Barbosa who would take them across the sea if they could capture a con-gnome who goes by Novak Brada.  Koveus and Lyra end up at a bar to ask about any new gnomes in the town while Dabdoob encounters some local drunks who have been complaining about a "fuckin' gnome" who they lost a lot of gold to. <br><br>
		After some investigating, they learn Novak has been conning the local residents and upon confronting him, he charms Koveus to be his friend while he tries to escape. Dabdoob ends up apprehending him but not quick enough as Novak successfully charms his as well. Knowing the only way to release Dabdoob from this charm is inflicting damage, Koveus springs into action, casting Eldritch Blast. It ends up releasing Dabdoob from the charm while cutting his HP in half and knocking Novak unconscious. Now fully back in control, Dabdoob agrees, fuckin' gnomes. <br><br>
		Returning to the ship with Vinny, Vanya and dragging along behind them the unconscious Novak Brada, Captain barbosa welcomes them back onto the ship just as nightfall hits and they make their way to Rozarria. Dabdoob dreams of his homeland which he may be returning to sooner than he'd like. He speaks with Vinny and learns of that a group of half-orcs were responsible for the abduction of Vinny's wife, Vanya's mother.<br><br>
		While Koveus and Lyra admire the stars, the ship is ambushed by aquatic humanoid figures known as the Kuo-Toa. In a victorious fight, Dabdoob protects Vinny and Vanya, Koveus blasted one of the creatures back to the depths, Lyra toppling one over from the crow's nest and Barbosa slicing one up. After discarding the corpses into the sea, the rest of the night remained uneventful and as dawn crested, the land of Rozarria entered their sight.

	<div class = "content">

		<p>
		The party and Barbosa's ship land at Balfonheim Port, the main trade port for the economy of Rozarria. The 3 heroes said a temporary goodbye to Vinny and Vanya who would be staying with Vinny's brother, Hinno, the local cobbler. <br><br>
		Learning that an individual named The Broker is the one who hired Captain Barbosa to bring Novak Brada back, Barbosa led them to the Narrow Nightingale where they left Novak inside a crate to be collected by the Broker. The party split at this point, agreeing to meet at the Pink Salmon Bar soon.<br><br>
		Koveus fearing they had just led Novak to his death, went back to look for him but stumbled upon The Broker torturing Novak. Koveus tried to make a move to save Novak but after his disguise fails, he ran out of fear for his own life. Koveus ran across town where he ultimately ran into an imp, which he formed an unnatural bond with.
		At the Pink Salmon, Lyra encounters a young human male named Anando who after a few friendly wagers, forfeited a map of Rozarria to her.<br><br>
		Food and drink were had but screams and a large shadow filled the streets not long after. Running to the scene of the disturbance, the party were face to face with a Vrock, a large demon with the likeness of a vulture with 4 legs. As the party seemed to be too weak to take this creature down, an unknown individual stepped in and with his lightning elemental attacks, scared the creature away.<br><br>
		This shiny blue armour wearing individual disapproved of the party's actions, telling them that they only angered the creature and it could have been worse had he not stepped in. Seeing as the party was more of a nuisance than help, this unknown knight told the guards to seize them and that they could be useful in non-endangering work.
		Barbosa stepped in and suggested that The Broker deal with them instead, for which the knight agreed reluctantly.<br><br>
		Barbosa tells the party that the unknown man is known as Tempest, who happens to be affiliated with the Slayer's Take, a group that Barbosa agreed to tell them more about another time. Barbosa led the party back to the Narrow Nightingale, where he introduced them to The Broker who offered them their freedom if they can obtain an artifact found in an abandoned mine along the coast.<br><br>
		Before they set off and prepared for the morning's journey, Novak Brada appeared as a servant to The Broker, missing his right hand as well as his tongue.

	<div class = "content">
		<p class="date">November 24, 2019</p>
		<p>
		The party purchased horses to ease their travel to the abandoned mine, which they found out was half a day's journey north following coast.<br><br>
		After finding the mine's entrance the party cautiously proceeded into it encountering dwarf zombies. After a brief fight, Dabdoob uncovers a mysterious long sword that seemed to be giving off a magical presence.<br><br>
		The party dove deeper into the mine in search of this artifact, fighting off large spiders until they found the main blacksmith room of this mine. Here the party were confronted by 2 phase spiders (human heads with the ability to turn invisible where the pair made their intention to eat the party very clear.<br><br>
		The party defeated these spider-like beings and found a pile of loot that was oddly paced in a pile close to a magical ever-burning fire. In it they found the round artifact they were looking for and Lyra found an odd coin with the symbol of a raven on it.<br><br>
		While exiting the abandoned mine, the mysterious blade that Dabdoob wielded, spoke, asking him if Dabdoob was its new wielder.

	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Session 4: All That For A Drink?</button>
	<div class = "content">
		<p class="date">December 12, 2019</p>
		<p>
		The party returned to Balfonheim Port with the treasures they had found. To the party's surprise and annoyance, The Broker broke the artifact and infused its contents into a drink that smelled unbelievably wonderful. As the party was not pleased with the risk they had taken for the Broker's desire, they rejected The Broker's aid in getting into the Slayer's Take.<br><br>
		They then determine that the headquarters for the Slayer's take would be in Archades aon their way out of town, Koveus convinced Dabdoob that they should visit his old home of Giruveigan.<br><br>
		Travelling off any roads or paths, they find an overturned carriage and gruesome carnage created by a young Nalfashnee. The party made quick work of this ruthless and teleporting demon and found that a pentagram had been burned into the ground nearby. They analyzed this symbol and concluded that this may have been a portal that the beast went through to get to the overworld.<br><br>
		By nightfall, the party had arrived at the wooded area just outside of Giruveigan.

	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Session 5: Homecoming</button>
	<div class = "content">
		<p class="date">December 19, 2019</p>
		<p>
		As night fell, the party wandered towards Giruveigan and Dabdoob found old sentiments and reminders of the remains of a home that once was.<br><br>
		They came across the location of Dabdoob's village but what stood before them were small vacated wooden buildings and huts. Further investigation led them to find odd, mutated humanoid figures who crusted skin and white soulless eyes roving the land. Dabdoob and Koveus were able to take out one of them silently while Lyra investigated other areas.<br><br>
		Lyra found 2 hellhounds and tried to converse with them but was interrupted by a small figure aggravating the canines, forcing them to chase after them. The figure ends up performing some Home Alone sort of shenanigans on the hell hounds, killing them both. Pissed off with the deaths of her potential pets, Lyra fires an arrow at the figure which almost immediately kills it. Discovering the unknown figure was a young girl with dark brown hair, the party revives her and discovers a manmade circular barricade had been set up. The party screamed out for passage, looking for medical aid for the young girl.<br><br>
		The tribe who had built the barricade let's the party in and thus began a tense conversation. The party learned that the tribe residing there had been the ones that had massacred Dabdoob's tribe but also Dabdoob's tribe may have done to the tribe residing here before them. The current tribe was led by a man Surva who had taken over after his younger brother, Faran, had scratched his own eyes out, fallen ill and looked to have aged faster than any normal person should. Surva told them about the zombified creatures roaming the area were called Husks and was not sure if this the curse or disease was contagious.<br><br>
		After some aggression from either side, Koveus convinces Dabdoob with the help of magic to leave the tent while he and Lyra try and convince Surva to leave Giruveigan and save his people.

	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Session 6: Arrival At Archades</button>
	<div class = "content">
		<p class="date">January 4, 2019</p>
		<p>
		Surva agreed to leave Giuveigan with his people within a fortnight. Upon resting, Surva asked Dabdoob to take the life of his brother as consolidation for his people as Faran would not be able to make the journey anyways. Dabdoob refused as his own people would not have agreed with this action. Instead Surva was forced to take his brother's life instead with Dabdoob there for support. In Faran's dying breath, Dabdoob hears Faran's obscure words of caution.<br><br>
		As the party left, Koveus vowed to send a messenger pigeon in a fortnight to confirm that Surva had left.<br><br>
		Upon arrival at Archades, while Koveus was "WOW-ing" at all the things in the Archade's market, Lyra was pulled aside by a one-horned tiefling, calling her Lady and claiming himself to be Ekemon Paradas. At this point a man named Butch, his blink dog and 2 hired henchmen had trapped the party in an alleyway wanting the horns of the 3 tieflings. Making quick work of the bandits, Butch and his dog escaped, leaving the party with a badly injured bandit. When the guards showed up, Koveus had the bandit singing like a canary.

	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Session 7: The First Hunt</button>
	<div class = "content">
		<p class="date">January 9, 2019</p>
		<p>
		The group spent the night at The Sober Miner where Lyra bargained for her luck and unfortunately had to pass coal rather than gold. Upon the morning, in search of the Butch character, they went to the black-market and found some drugged up citizens who sneakily stole money from Dabdoob.The party ended up catching Butch who agreed to be their ear in the black-market as Koveus threatened his life.<br><br>
		The party then travelled through the High Market and past Iscalon Fortress to arrive at the Slayer's Take. Inside they met Allistor Cydonia who accepted their application and sent them on a small job to test their abilities.
		Their job led to a rather outrageous woman named Madame Lafond who wasn't the kindest and told them about some ugly beasts who almost took her boy and that she wanted the beasts' heads. <br><br>
		The party went into the sewers and captured an insectoid like creature, a goblin and found a small boy, Alex, who broke his ankle falling through a sewer grate. While talking to the boy, they learned that the insectoid creature and goblin had been bringing food for the boy.<br><br>
		Lyra healed the boy's injuries, Dabdoob wanted to finish the job was forcefully persuaded to spare them by Koveus' magic and Dabdoob took the boy home. Lyra and Koveus let the 2 'beasts' go.<br><br>
		The party convinced Lafond into thinking the head of the Nalfashnee was from one of the sewer monsters and the other beast had been completely incinerated in their fight.

	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Session 8: Shopping And A Date</button>
	<div class = "content">
		<p class="date">January 23, 2019</p>
		<p>
		The party graciously accepted the reward money for their completed job. Upon reporting about an insectoid like creature, they learned that this was the first occurrence inside the capital but there had been rare sightings of them in the Moshporan Wasteland.<br><br>
		Allistor then requested that the group take on another issue in the south in the village of Bhujerba. Details were provided that the wildlife had becoming increasingly aggressive in the past month or so, a few incidents of animals stealing food or threatening people. Their contact in Bhujerba was the local bar-handler, Marnia Silvertan.<br><br>
		The group then inquired about shops or places to spend their hard-earned gold at which led to a very lengthy but interesting evening. <br><br>
		The first stop was to the Block and Anvil where the green mohawked dwarf named Milithan was introduced. Offering fair prices for his works, Lyra and Dabdoob received armour and Milithan told Dabdoob that the blade was most likely done by his father, given the accent of the White Leviathan Raven feather (Milithan's mother's favourite bird) attached to the hilt.<br><br>
		The next stop was to a fletcher shop known as Bound Accuracy. Here they met the lovely amber haired, dark skinned, half elf Sinthian, where she sold Lyra 12 bending arrows after Lyra was demonstrated how to use them. Sinthian requested that if Lyra found more of the specific feathers found from a mythical bird called a Lolith of the Night, she could fabricate more. This portion ended with Koveus asking Sinthian on a date.
		Sol's Soul Entrancing Items was the next stop where the party was greeted with an odd, tall, golden short-fur fellow named Pumat Sol. HE sold the party some items, and also he inquired about Dabdoob's sword, saying he can give it a look over for a price. Dabddoob refused saying he would rather not know what the sword is. <br><br>
		The party then split, wanting to pursue their own interests, how lovely that was for a DM.<br><br>
		Dabdoob went to the black market where he came across Butch who told him about the things you could buy in the market. Butch pointed him to a black powder merchant named Smevil where Dabdoob bought 4 small pouches worth (a hog's head). Butch also mentioned he would investigate any news about slaves being sold, specifically half-orc slaves.
		Lyra spent her time at a bath where after slowly drifting off, she awoke to a deep feminine voice called to her.<br><br>
		Koveus gathered flowers and went to Bound Accuracy to see Sinthian, it ended up being a romantic night stroll to the Statue of Bahamut and back. He ended up telling her his life story to fill the silence.

	<button type="button" class="collapsible">Session 9: A Forest Inquiry</button>
	<div class = "content">
		<p class="date">February 22, 2019</p>
		<p>
		The party travelled to Bhujerba where they saved a few orcs from an enraged wolf. Bringing the wolf corpse with them, they met Marnia Silvertan and saw her husband come back with his hunting party, bloody and beaten. Her husband described an encounter with an owl-bear that was far more aggressive than he would have expected.<br><br>
		While the party weighed their options, a strange mist entered the town and stole the wolf corpse. In pursuit of the mist, the party found themselves in a nearby forest where they were attacked by the same owl bear.<br><br>
		Killing the creature and carrying the body back to Bhujerba with the intention of using the body as bait, the party prepared for whatever was in the mist.<br><br>
		When the mist arrived for the owl bear's body, the party found a leshen at the center. With the help of Koveus' fire, the group took down the leshen. With that they headed back to Archades.

	<div class = "content">
		<p class="date">March 5, 2019, 2019</p>
		<p>
		In the Slayer's Take, the party ran into Lucius Strongborn, King of Rozarria, who asked them about their personal goals and their allegiance to Rozarria.<br><br>
		News also travelled to the group that the yearly ball was to take place in just over a week's time.<br><br>
		Dabdoob was informed by Butch that a shipment of slaves was being moved soon and that the buyer most likely would be attending the ball. The only issue was that they would not be allowed to enter unless they were of nobility or a member of the Slayer's Take.
		Allistor then sent them on their way to Jahar, where they begrudgingly met their Slayer's Take 'mentor', Tempest, who looked to be more of a celebrity more than last time they had seen him. <br><br>
		He told them about the Vrock and asked how they were to go about taking down the beast. After coming up with some clever ideas, the party went on their way and tracked the beast to its nest...where they then proceeded to remember that they did not prepare any of their ideas.<br><br>
		As the battle on the cliff took place, Tempest was able to lasso the demon and Dabdoob took its head as it tried to fly away. In the final moments of battle, Tempest's helmet came off, revealing a familiar face to Dabdoob, his best friend Garosh.
