		After the events in Voltera, Vinny suggests to the party to make their way across the Nabreus sea to meet with his brother in Rozarria who could provide work for them.
The party found a ship, ran by Captain Barbosa who will take them across the sea if they can capture a conman Gnome known as Novak Brada  <br><br>
Koveus and Lyra end up at a bar to ask about any new gnomes in the town while Dabdoob encounters some local drunks who have been complaining about a "fuckin' gnome' who they lost a good amount of gold to. <br><br>
After some investigating,  they find that the Gnome has been conning the local citizens, and upon confronting him he charms Koveus to be his friend while he tries to escape. Dabdoob ends up apprehending him but not quick enough as Novak successfully charms his as well.
Knowing the only way to release Dabdoob from this charm is inflicting damage, Koveus springs into action, casting Eldritch Blast. It ends up releasing Dabdoob from the charm while cutting his HP in half and knocking Novak unconscious in the spell's wake. Now fully back in control, Dabdoob agrees, 'fuckin' gnomes'.<br><br>
Returnign to the ship with Vinny, Vanya and dragging along behind them Novak Brada, Captain barbosa welcomes them back onto the ship just as nightfall hits and they make their way to Rozarria.<br><br>
After Dabdoob awakes in a cold sweat, he and Vinny  chat amongst the stars about Vinny's sad past.<br><br>
While Koveus and Lyra admire the stars, the entire ship is ambushed by the aquatic humanoid figures known as the Kuo-Toa. In a victorious fight, Dabdoob protects Vinny and Vanya, Koveus blasting back to where it came from, Lyra toppling one over from the crow's nest and Barbosa slicing one up. <br><br>
After discarding the corpses into the sea, the remaining of the night remains quiet and as dawn crests, the land of Rozarria enters into sight.
